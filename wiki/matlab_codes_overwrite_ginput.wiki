{{{
%GINPUT Graphical input from mouse.
%   [X,Y] = GINPUT(N) gets N points from the current axes and returns 
%   the X- and Y-coordinates in length N vectors X and Y.  The cursor
%   can be positioned using a mouse (or by using the Arrow Keys on some 
%   systems).  Data points are entered by pressing a mouse button
%   or any key on the keyboard except carriage return, which terminates
%   the input before N points are entered.
%
%   [X,Y] = GINPUT gathers an unlimited number of points until the
%   return key is pressed.
% 
%   [X,Y,BUTTON] = GINPUT(N) returns a third result, BUTTON, that 
%   contains a vector of integers specifying which mouse button was
%   used (1,2,3 from left) or ASCII numbers if a key on the keyboard
%   was used.
%
%   Examples:
%       [x,y] = ginput;
%
%       [x,y] = ginput(5);
%
%       [x, y, button] = ginput(1);
