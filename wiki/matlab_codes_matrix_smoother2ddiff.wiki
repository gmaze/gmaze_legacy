% SMOOTHER2DDIFF Apply a diffusive smoother on a 2D field
%
% [field_out,tmp3x,tmp3y] = smoother2Ddiff(field_in,dist_in1,dist_in2);
%
% Apply a diffusive smoother based on Weaver and Courtier, 2001.
%
% field_in:		field to be smoothed (masked with NaN)
% dist_in1/2:	scale in first/second direction
% field_out:	smoothed field
%
% The domain is assumed cyclic in both directions.
% If it is not, you want to mask edge points with NaNs.
